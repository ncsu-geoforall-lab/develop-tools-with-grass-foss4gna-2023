    "# GRASS Tool in C\n",
    "\n",
    "For some tools, C (or C++) is a good choice of language because an algorithm or model requires fine work with the data. For example, a loop in Python over all vector points or raster cells may be prohibitively slow. When this cannot be compensated by available Python libraries or use of GRASS C libraries through the ctypes API or grass.pygrass wrappers, writing a tool directly in C is the most common approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "GRASS tools written in C (and C++) can be distributed in exactly the same way as tools in Python. For Windows, they are compiled on project servers. For other systems, they are compiled on the user machine. Python, C, and C++ tools can be and are being published in the grass-addons repository with users noticing the difference only in case of bugs."

    "In case of C, compilation is necessary to execute the program, so typically, the low-level command _make_ is used to do the compilation. The specific use may differ based on the development environment, but often you may want to compile whole GRASS GIS yourself and simply add the compiled tool to that build instead of installing it as an addon (which is what happens with _g.extension_). In that case, _make_ is used with `MODULE_TOPDIR` variable which is set to where the GRASS source code is, e.g.:\n",
