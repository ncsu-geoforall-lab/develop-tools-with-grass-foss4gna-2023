    "| t | temporal data processing | t.rast.aggregate: temporal aggregation |\n",
    "| g | general data management | g.rename: renames map |\n",
    "| d | display | d.rast: display raster map |\n",

    "Generally, the idea is to include only one or two dots. All core tools comply with this rule, but some addons break it. Sometimes, this suggests further grouping.

First keyword is the tool family of the tool, so, e.g., for vector tools, which has names starting with `v.`, the keyword is `vector`. Second keyword is a topic which is more highlighted in the documentation than other keywords. If possible, tools should use one of [existing topics](https://grass.osgeo.org/grass82/manuals/topics.html). Tool should have at least one other keyword. These can include other data types the tool works with, the name of the specific process it implements, or synonyms for the terms used in its name and description. Keywords can contain more than one word and can be understood as general labels or tags as long as they are adding to identification of the tool in searches. Reuse of [existing keywords](https://grass.osgeo.org/grass82/manuals/keywords.html) is encouraged. Keywords in Python are specified using as follows:\n",
